Political factors included the growing influence of Enlightenment ideals, a monarchy that failed to keep up with the changing times, and the formation of the Estates General. Economic factors included high levels of taxation and debt, subsistence agriculture, and unfair distribution of wealth. Military factors included the legacy of repeated wars and the absence of a standing army. Social factors included extreme poverty and social inequality.</p>\n    <h3>Stages of the Revolution</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>1789 - The French Revolution Begins:</strong> The Estates General meets, the Tennis Court Oath is taken, the National Assembly is formed, the Bastille is stormed, and the Great Fear sweeps across the country.</li>\n      <li><strong>1791 - Constitutional Monarchy:</strong> A Constitution is written, a new Legislative Assembly is formed, and a constitutional monarchy is established.</li>\n      <li><strong>1792 - The Reign of Terror:</strong> Louis XVI is executed, the Jacobins gain power, and a bloody period of repression and terror ensues.</li>\n      <li><strong>1799 - The End of the Revolution:</strong> Napoleon Bonaparte seizes power and declares himself emperor, ending the Revolution.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h3>Impact of the Revolution</h3>\n    <p>The French Revolution changed the course of history by reshaping government and society, creating a new political and social order which influenced the rest of Europe. The Revolution had a lasting impact on politics and social life, as well as the economy. It made democratic ideas more widely accepted, challenged the power of the Church and aristocracy, and gave people a greater sense of individual rights.

It also increases worker motivation, encourages recruitment, and reduces workplace stress. Additionally, a higher minimum wage can stimulate economic growth due to increased consumer spending. \n\nOn the negative side, the imposition of a minimum wage reduces the number of available job opportunities due to the resulting increase in labor costs. This can result in fewer people being employed and an increase in underemployment. A higher minimum wage can also be cost prohibitive for small businesses, as they may not be able to afford to hire low-skilled workers. Additionally, a minimum wage increase might lead to price increases for consumers, due to increased production costs for businesses. \n\nIn conclusion, a national minimum wage can help bolster the economy by increasing the wages of workers and encouraging economic growth. There are also potential negative economic implications, however, such as reducing job availability and increasing prices for consumers. Each country should carefully consider the implications and impacts of a national minimum wage before implementing it.",

As temperatures and weather patterns become increasingly unpredictable, wildlife is struggling to adapt to and survive in a rapidly changing environment. From increasing floods and droughts, to the introduction of new species, climate change continues to have a devastating impact on the biodiversity of entire species across all environments.\n\nThe issues presented by climate change have been felt by a diverse array of species. Polar bears have been among the most vulnerable, as their icy habitats, which are essential for hunting and sleeping, continue to melt and shrink. Other species, such as coral, are becoming increasingly susceptible to rising ocean temperatures, leading to a form of \u201cbleaching\u201d, which can devastate entire reefs and ecosystems.   Sea levels continue to rise, while fragile aquatic habitats experience increasingly acidic waters, both which can cause immeasurable damage to delicate marine species.\n\nIn terrestrial habitats, increasing temperatures and extreme weather events are forcing animals to migrate to find more suitable habitats. As habitats shrink and become more fragmented, some species are struggling to survive due to a lack of resources and suitable nesting ground. Changes in temperature can also cause disruption to the reproductive cycles of species, leading to decreased or non-existent breeding.\n\nClimate change continues to have a tremendous impact on the population of vulnerable species around the world, and it is important to understand its implications for the long-term wellbeing of wildlife. By gaining an understanding of the effects of climate change, conservation groups and citizens can work to identify and protect habitats that may be impacted by changes in weather and temperature. In addition, changes in public policy and laws can help reduce the spread and intensity of climate change, giving wildlife a better chance of adapting and surviving in a rapidly changing world.",
